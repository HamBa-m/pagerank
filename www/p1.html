		<h2>Q-Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications</h2>
		<p>Abstract: Q-learning is a popular and powerful method for solving reinforcement learning problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of Q-learning, including its theoretical foundations, practical algorithms, and applications in various domains. We start by introducing the basic concepts of reinforcement learning and Q-learning, and then discuss the key challenges in designing effective Q-learning algorithms. We review several important extensions of Q-learning, such as SARSA, Double Q-learning, and Deep Q-Networks, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We also present several real-world applications of Q-learning, including game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving, and discuss the insights and lessons learned from these applications. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open research problems and future directions in Q-learning research.</p>
