		<h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>
		<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm for solving complex sequential decision-making problems. This paper introduces a novel framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses recurrent neural networks to capture long-term dependencies in the environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging tasks, including game playing and robotic control.</p>
