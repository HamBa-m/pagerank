		<h2>Efficient Q-Learning using Neural Networks</h2>
		<p>Abstract: Q-learning is a popular method for solving reinforcement learning problems, but it can be computationally expensive for large state-action spaces. This paper proposes an efficient Q-learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function. We show that our algorithm outperforms traditional Q-learning on several benchmark problems, while using fewer computational resources.</p>
